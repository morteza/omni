# OmniRest

*OmniRest* is an ongoing effort to collect and model multi-modal resting-state brain data, including rs-EEG, rs-MEG, rs-fMRI, eye tracking, and behavioral data. The data is collected from multiple sources and will be made available in a format that facilitates multi-modal modeling of the human brain.


## Contributions

We welcome all kinds of contributions. If you have resting-state or any other type of cognitive data related to the human brain that you'd like to share, please reach out to us. Weâ€™d be delighted to include your data in our repository.
